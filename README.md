# Ducky_Wifi_Passwd_Grabber


This is a simple script that opens a command prompt and copies all the wifi passwords that the target device has ever connected to.

WIFI_GRABBER_MAIL

This script does not require the rubber ducky to be flashed with the twinduck firmware. However, if yours has the twinduck, this should work fine.
Make sure that the lesssecureapps on the sender's gmail is turned on. Check yours from here "https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps".
Make changes only to Sender_Email, Sender_Pass and the Reveiver_Email.

WIFI_GRABBER_TWINDUCK

For the Wifi_Grabber_TwinDuck script, you need to have flashed the rubber ducky with the twinduck firmware before you execute this script, else this will not work.

WORKING OF THE SCRIPT!!

The Mail script is a bit slow as it exports all the access points details and stores them in a folder in the Desktop and zips the folder. Then the zip file
is mailed to the receiver's email address. The zip file will contain all the networks in a seperate .xml file with all its information. But not to worry the script ends with everything being cleaned.

USAGE!!!

JUST COPY THE SCRIPT AND ENCODE IT WITH THE DUCKY ENCODER. I PREFER "https://ducktoolkit.com/encode", but you can use any. 
THEN JUST DOWNLOAD THE ENCODED inject.bin AND PLACE IT IN THE SD CARD OF THE RUBBER DUCKY!!

YOU CAN TWEAK WITH THE DELAY TIMING BASED ON THE VICTIM's COMPUTER SPEED.
