# Ducky_Wifi_Passwd_Grabber

This is a simple script that opens a command prompt and copies all the wifi passwords that the target device has ever connected to.

This script does not require the rubber ducky to be flashed with the twinduck firmware. However, if yours has the twinduck, this should work fine.
Make sure that the lesssecureapps on the sender's gmail is turned on. Check yours from here "https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps".
Make changes only to Sender_Email, Sender_Pass and the Reveiver_Email.




WORKING OF THE SCRIPT!!

This script is a bit slow as it exports all the access points details and stores them in a folder in the Desktop. Then the folder is zipped and the zip file
is mailed to the Receiver. The zip file will contain all the networks in a seperate .xml file with all its information. But not to worry the script ends with
everything being cleaned.
